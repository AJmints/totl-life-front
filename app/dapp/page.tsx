                <p>First, I want to apologize for the sinful amount of divs and :any that were used for the start of this project. Also the amount of useState drilling I have done all over the forum components.</p><br/><br/>
                <p>I am working on creating a list for anyone to jump into pick up various tasks to work on the project, if they want to contribute to this project. Totl is being built to be the best forum possible, with dreams to become something more, but if this is a project that is a nice portfolio piece, then it is still a win in my book.</p>
