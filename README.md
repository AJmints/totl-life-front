# Totl.Life

You are turtle on a river and found a log with other turtles.

## Welcome to Totl.life

We have some goals and aspirations with this project, but it is first and foremost a project to explore web development, build community, and have fun.

The intention with this project is to build an MVP to see how we would wish to go forward in the future when re-architecting the backend. The current version is an exploratory vision with the features desired in a real product. The future goal will be to use the best industry practices in a future version designed to scale and meet current security standards along with a clean UI/UX, server side rendering, TDD and a refined system architecture.
