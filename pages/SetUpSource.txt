Currently working to understand how to set up a Proxy server 
in order to pass JWT from front to back through HTTP Cookies in Headers.

The source I am using is...
Source: 1
post: https://maxschmitt.me/posts/next-js-http-only-cookie-auth-tokens
git example: https://github.com/maximilianschmitt/next-auth

Not sure if I need to use this approach, but looking into it.

I am taking the approach shown in source 2 for now. I am trying to avoid using axios.
