                    <p>We take inspiration from the reddit format, where logs are equivalent to subreddits. Since we are all turtles, we need a log.</p>

                    <p>Totl.Life is starting off as a forum, with aspirations to evolve into something more.</p><br/>
                    <p>Totl wants to start off as a forum to help build the community that identifies as a turtle on a log. There is a lot of work to be done. We have plans to bring in other technologies to help build Totl.Life into something more impactful as time goes on. Our primary mission is to support the conservation of the ecosystems in Missouri and build a community that will help us in our mission. We also want to be a hub for all the nature lovers of MO to organize, meet up, connect, share ideas, and take care of each other along with nature!</p>

                    <p>We are just having fun and want to create a community with like minded Totlers</p><br/>
                    <p>In the summer of 2023, a friend group went down the Current River in Missouri and did a 3 day float. Not an unusual activity in MO. In fact, this is a very popular recreation for many Missourians and beyond! They were goofin, and floating, and having a good time when a few of the friends of this group started dreaming of giving back to the river that creates such fond memories, a piece of MO that is truely serene. That is when the idea of Totl was born. This idea has manifested into a forum website with dreams to grow into something more.</p>
