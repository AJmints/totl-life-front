                    This user agreement is as deep as the Marianas Trench, and as shallow as a puddle. Its interpretation may or may not require a snorkel. 
                    If you find yourself submerged in confusion, resurface and breathe in the fresh air of amusement. 
                    Our lawyers are on vacation, so there&#39;s no one to sue â€“ just kidding (but not really).

                    We encourage diversity, inclusivity, and a celebration of all water creatures. 
                    Whether you&#39;re a buoyant buoy or a cool catfish, our waves of satire don&#39;t discriminate. 
                    Keep the tides of tolerance high, and let the laughter ripple across every bend in the river.

                    Dive into the river of jokes at your own risk. 
                    There&#39;s no lifeguard on duty to rescue you from a comedic whirlpool, or to hold your hand as you navigate rough waters. 
                    If you find yourself in deep waters, stay afloat as best you can.  Remember, words can&#39;t sink your raft, and don&#39;t wake Larry.

                    Help us keep our riverbanks clean from negativity and grumpiness. 
                    Dispose of any frowns responsibly, and remember that laughter is the only litter allowed. 
                    Leave the river better than you found it, with a smile on your face.
